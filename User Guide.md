<ul>
  <li>Don't use space to create file and directory(folder) names. For example this is wrong: "My First Bash Script" but this is true: "My_First_Bash_Script"</li>
  <li>When giving different folders as input to the application, do not forget to leave a colon between the names of different folders.</li>
<li>Be sure script.ps1 and directories(folders) -the will be zipped- in the same folder. You can change directory usind `cd` and you can be sure with `kod burada` to you are in the right directory.</li>
</ul>
